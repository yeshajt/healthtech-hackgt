### Mental Health

I read something (i cant find it atm) that said the first thing you see/hear at the start of a day sets the tone for the rest of it. The idea for this app/website is you replace your boring old morning alarm with this app. It will play good news, music, quotes etc instead of an alarm. It also can link with services such as google keep/caledar, notion, todoist to read off your daily tasks (if they dont make you sad). I could also link with spotify or apple music if you have those subscriptions. The motivation behind the app is to motivate you to start the day strong...*cringe*

### Fitness and Nutrition

An app/website were restuarants can pool together the leftover food and supplies at the end of the day. The app tracks what food is available for the next day and sets up a way for it to be delivered. It also contains features to combine the food into nutritious packages and/or short fitness tips. This *could* work for global or rural health, but the assumption is that is used in cities where there are a lot of homeless people and food waste. The close proximity between them make perishable food delivery more feasible.
