**Mental health:**
- Someone writes a diary entry into the app - based on how theyre feeling we give them suggestions
    - ie. If do a mood detecter on the diary entry and if it’s very sad then give them motivational messages, drink water, talk to someone you love
- 

**Inpatient health:**
- App system for nurses and doctors
    - Gives them a todo list every time they go into a room that needs to be cleaned
    - Patients can submit “tickets” if they need something (non urgent)
- You know how when the doctor comes, they ask you basic questions like have you been outside the country recently, have you been sleeping well, etc.
    - Create an app where while a patient is waiting in the waiting room, they can fill out those basic questions themselves in the patient portal so they can waste  less time with the doctor and talk about important things
    - When the nurse checks weight and height, they can enter that info in the patient’s portal
    - The doctor is able to see all of this info in a easy to read and quick format so they can talk about the things that matter with the patient

**Fitness and nutrition:**
- 

**Woman’s health:**
- Pcos diet based nutrition app
    - Not focused on calorie counting or dieting but overall well-being
    - People can set goals
    - Important things: stress level, water consumption, type of exercise, protein levels
    - They can input a “symptom” to see if it’s related to pcos or not
        - Ie “thick facial hair” -> yes, natural remedies to improve
        - Ie “headaches” -> not necessarily…
