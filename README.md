### Mental Health

### Inpatient Health

1. A scheduling assistant that helps people schedule hard-to-come-by appointments with specialists. The assistant notifies people when appointments are made available, and makes it easy for people to reach out to staff at hospitals and provides aid for people with disabilities who may issues communicating their needs to doctors when scheduling appointments.
2. There's an app called Flora which increases productivity by growing a "tree" in the app for every productive session without your phone. The same principle can be applied to make a blood donation tracking app. Less than 10% of American adults donate blood reguarly, and this app can store important information about their personal health, help them schedule appointments to donate blood, and they can "grow a tree" every time they donate. The app can also help users cut down on paperwork and other logistical challenges.

1. An app/organizing tool that creates customized meal plans for students that help them use up all their meal swipes and maintain a nutritious diet.

### Women's + Reproductive Health

### Global/Rural Health
